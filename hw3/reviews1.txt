-1 But it does n't leave you with much .
-1 You could hate it for the same reason .
-1 There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
-1 Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
2 The performances are an absolute joy .
